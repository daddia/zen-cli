# Zen Writing Style Guidelines

# Zen Communication Guide

## Voice Principles
- Calm, clear, and confident — never noisy
- Minimal words, maximum signal
- Guide the user into flow; remove friction
- Professional, approachable, and human
- No emojis — clarity carries the tone

## Tone & Style
- Prefer simple, everyday words
- Use active voice and present tense
- Be concise but complete; cut filler
- Lead with the outcome, then the how
- Encourage without hype (quiet confidence)

**Examples**
- “Zen commands to get you flowing”
- “Start your zenspace”
- "Access the Zen assets library”

## Microcopy Patterns

### Section / CTA Labels
- Start here
- Create a zenspace
- Keep the flow
- See what’s possible
- Learn as you go

**Zen-styled variants**
- Zen commands to get you flowing
- Zen help to keep you flowing
- Access the Zen assets library

### Buttons
- Do: “Run command”, “View details”, “Try again”
- Zen: “Run zen”, “View flow”
- Don’t: “Click here”, “Submit now!!!”

### Links & Hints
- “Need a hand? See Zen help.”
- “New to zenflow? Start here.”

## Documentation & Messages
- Provide just enough context, then an example
- Show the next action (one step, not five)
- Use consistent names for things (one term per concept)

**Template**
- What it is → Why it matters → How to do it → What next

## Error Messages & Help Text
- Acknowledge briefly, guide clearly, close calmly

**Pattern**
1. Name the issue (plain language)
2. Say why it happened (if useful)
3. Offer one clear next step (with a command or link)
4. Optional: add a short tip

**Examples**
- “We couldn’t reach the registry. Try `zen sync` to reconnect, then run that command again.”
- “This template isn’t installed. Run `zen templates add <name>` to get it flowing.”

**Avoid**
- Blame (“you did X wrong”)
- Jargon without a fix
- Wall-of-text explanations

## Empty States & Success
- Empty: invite the first simple action
  - “No templates yet. Add your first to keep the flow.”
- Success: confirm and point forward
  - “Template added. Use `zen new` to start from it.”

## Word Choices (prefer → avoid)
- set up / add / remove → configure / utilize / execute
- start / begin → commence / initiate
- write / draft → generate
- fix / resolve → remediate
- help / guidance → assistance (formal)

## Consistency Rules
- Sentence case for headings and buttons
- Use “Zen” as a quiet guide, not a slogan
- One idea per sentence; one action per step
- No exclamation marks; let clarity do the work

## Quick Checklist (before you ship)
- Is the outcome obvious in the first line?
- Is there exactly one next step?
- Are the words simple and consistent?
- Does it sound calm and confident?
- Would this help someone keep their flow?
