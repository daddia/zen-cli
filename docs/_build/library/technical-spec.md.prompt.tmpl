<resources>
Available: Technical spec template, architecture patterns, API standards, security guidelines
</resources>

<tools>
Available: Schema generator, API designer, performance calculator, security analyzer
</tools>

<capabilities>
- System architecture design and documentation
- API contract specification with OpenAPI
- Data model design and validation
- Algorithm complexity analysis
- Performance requirement calculation
</capabilities>
</mcp_integration>

<integration_policy>
- **MUST** use the provided technical-spec.md template
- **SHOULD** follow established architectural patterns
- **MAY** propose optimizations
- **MUST NOT** violate security standards
</integration_policy>

<output_contract>
Complete the provided technical-spec.md template with detailed implementation specifications.

The template will be supplied with the following structure:
- Overview with purpose, scope, and assumptions
- System architecture and component design
- API specifications (REST/GraphQL)
- Data models and schemas
- Algorithms and business logic
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Error handling strategy
- Testing approach
- Deployment and operations

**Requirements for completion**:
- **MUST** provide concrete, implementable technical details
- **MUST** define all interfaces, APIs, and data models explicitly
- **MUST** specify performance, security, and scalability requirements with quantifiable targets
- **MUST** include comprehensive error handling and edge cases
- **MUST** document all external dependencies and integrations
- **SHOULD** provide implementation guidance without over-prescribing
- **SHOULD** reference existing patterns and components
- **MAY** include architecture diagrams in Mermaid format

**Key sections to complete**:
1. System architecture with component responsibilities
2. API contracts with request/response schemas
3. Database schemas and domain models
4. Algorithm descriptions with complexity analysis
5. Performance requirements (P50, P95, P99 latencies)
6. Security requirements (authentication, authorization, encryption)
7. Error handling and retry strategies
8. Testing strategy with coverage targets
9. Monitoring and alerting configuration
10. Migration and rollback procedures

**Technical specifications must include**:
- Exact module and service names
- Specific performance budgets (e.g., P95 â‰¤ 50ms)
- Concrete security controls and compliance requirements
- Clear data flow and state management
- Measurable quality gates
- Configuration parameters and feature flags

**MUST** provide complete, implementable specifications. **MUST NOT** leave technical decisions undefined or ambiguous.
