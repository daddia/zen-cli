# Getting Started with Zen CLI

Welcome to Zen CLI - the AI-powered productivity suite that unifies product development from strategic planning to production deployment. This guide will help you install, configure, and master Zen's powerful workflow capabilities.

## What is Zen CLI?

Zen CLI is a comprehensive command-line tool that implements the **Zenflow methodology** - a 7-stage unified workflow that standardizes how teams move from strategy to shipped value. Whether you're a product manager defining requirements, a developer implementing features, or an operations engineer deploying to production, Zen provides the tools and structure to work efficiently and collaboratively.

### Key Features

- **Structured Task Management** - Organize work using the proven Zenflow methodology
- **External Integrations** - Connect seamlessly with Jira, GitHub, and other tools
- **Template System** - Generate consistent documentation and code structures
- **Asset Library** - Access shared templates, workflows, and best practices
- **Cross-Platform** - Native support for Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Core Concepts

Understand the fundamentals that make Zen powerful:

### Zenflow Methodology
The 7-stage workflow that structures all work in Zen:
1. **Align** - Define success criteria and stakeholder alignment
2. **Discover** - Gather evidence and validate assumptions
3. **Prioritize** - Rank work by value vs effort
4. **Design** - Specify implementation approach
5. **Build** - Deliver working software increment
6. **Ship** - Deploy safely to production
7. **Learn** - Measure outcomes and iterate

### Workspace Structure
Every Zen project is organized as a workspace:
- **`.zen/` directory** - Contains all Zen configuration and data
- **Task directories** - Structured folders for each work item
- **Asset library** - Shared templates and resources
- **Configuration files** - Project and user settings

### Task Types
Different types of work optimized for specific workflows:
- **Story** - User-facing features with UX focus
- **Bug** - Defect fixes with root cause analysis
- **Epic** - Large initiatives requiring breakdown
- **Spike** - Research and exploration
- **Task** - General work items
